## Tested on Virtual box using Vagrant
  bento/centos-7.2  (came with Python 2.7.5 installed)
  See more details in Vagrantfile

## Installed Flask using below commands

  mkdir myproject
  cd myproject
  python2 -m virtualenv venv
  cd /home/hadoop/myproject

```
## Ran using the below
```bash
  export  FLASK_ENV=development
  export  FLASK_APP=myfirstapp
  flask run --host=192.168.77.10 ## since the machine does not have a browser I had to use below flask command instead of "flask run"
```
## Tested at below URL
```bash
  http://192.168.77.10:5000/
  http://192.168.77.10:5000/info
